The [Nes dev website](https://www.nesdev.org) and the [Nes dev wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki). Additionally, thanks to [Easy 6502](http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) for the 6502 assembly tutorial. There is also the section on [Emulation tutorials](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Emulation_tutorials) on the Nes Dev wiki, [Blargg's notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20190319195151/http://blargg.8bitalley.com/nes-emu/6502.html) on emulation and the [NES emulator development guide](https://gist.github.com/rhysd/ec4eec8b70dabc196a21a37c0ba4688e) (The original version is [here](https://www.nesdev.org/NES%20emulator%20development%20guide.txt)).
